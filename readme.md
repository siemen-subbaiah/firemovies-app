# Firemovies

Around 2 years back I had developed a [webapp](https://firemovies.netlify.app) called by the same name using react, this time I developed the same with react-native and expo

## Installation

Grab your firebase and TMDB credentials and create a .env file in the root and add them. While naming these make sure to append 'EXPO_PUBLIC' at the start.

```
npm install
```

##### Run using the expo go app
